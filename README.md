This is not a plugin!
This is an addon for ItemsAdder

Adds 312 blocks!

I'm not the owner of Blockus mod, I just converted the blocks to be compatible with ItemsAdder

How to install?
extract the content of the .zip file inside plugins/ItemsAdder/contents folder
use the command /iareload
use the command /iazip
(upload the pack on dropbox if you're using dropbox and update the config.yml url, then use /iareload to reload the config.yml)
finished, open the menu /ia or use /iaget and press tab
Some of the blocks

Animated blocks

Light Blocks

Pillar/Wood Types

And much much more!
